## My Sister's Rusty Bike

*written by Jim Aylesworth and illustrations by Richard Hull*

Published 1996. I will buy this book just for the artwork. It is somewhat nostalgic, but the art is incredibly well done, and I love how the book is laid out, simple, and with slight variations. The illustrations are full of things to look at and are silly, with lots of textures and striking colors to enchant the eye. Stunning. The story is nice, but I wish the rhythm set at the beginning of each page was subverted at some place and played with because I found it too repetitive towards the end and became unnecessary. Great message as well. <h style="color:#5ABB71;">★</h>

## Henry and the Yeti

*by Russell Ayto*

Published 2017. The artwork gives me the vibe of 'Hyperbole and a Half' and has a unique charm—a simple sweet story. I enjoy it when a child character journeys to see something unbelievable and beyond. It ends obviously, but also I didn't see it coming.

## Mouse in the House

*by Russell Ayto*

Published 2020. Lovely variety in the artwork of solid colors, textures, and exciting places to look. Nicely done. I liked the message and the story, but it was predictable in spots—still an enjoyable and worthwhile read.

## A Gardener's Alphabet

*by Mary Azarian*

Published 2000. It's an alphabet book with no direct story here, but the illustrations are excellent.

## Bub or The Very Best Thing

*by Natalie Babbitt*

Published 1994. Fantastic illustrations. The story is sweet, and I love how the images show what isn't in the text. The story reminds me in message and structure of "What is Love" by Mac Barnett and Carson Ellis. The story is wordier than it needs to be, but it still is an excellent read with a great message.
