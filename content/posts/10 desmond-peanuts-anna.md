Not my favorite group of books but absolutely loved Disappearing Desmond, if you get a chance it is a must read!

## Peanut

*by Linas Alsenas*

Published 2007. Simple and fun artwork and I enjoyed the story. It could have given us some perspective on the elephant. Still, the premise was silly; I did not care for the ending as much since Mildred had no character change, but overall it was a fun and silly read. Something about the simplicity and silly concept makes me enjoy this book, even if the story could be better.


## The Princess of 8th Street

*By Linas Alsenas*

Published 2012. The artwork isn’t for me, but still done nicely enough. The compositions are a bit one-note. The story is quite wordy, and I spaced out at times, but in the end, the message is good, but I feel the story could be better told.


## Disappearing Desmond

*By Anna Alter*

Published 2010. I really loved reading this book. The concept and message are fantastic, and the artwork and story are so well done. An excellent read that I recommend to anyone.


## Estelle and Lucy

*By Anna Alter*

Published 2001. I enjoyed the illustration and lovely linework over washes of color. The story was good, but I felt it could be better if we got more from the secondary character/friend. The ending is pleasant and satisfying, even if it isn’t fully developed.


## The Fox Wish

*By Kimiko Aman, Illustrated by Komako Sakai*

Published 2003. Simple story with no actual conflict and fantastic artwork. It was wordy. I mostly enjoyed this book for its visuals; the colors are wonderful, the drawings have great action, and overall really well illustrated.

Thank you for reading along with me this week,
