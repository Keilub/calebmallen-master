## The Moon Over Star

*written by Dianna Hutts Aston and illustrated by Jerry Pinkney*

Published 2008. What can I say? Art by Jerry Pinkney is always astonishing and captivating. The story was a complex meandering of a moment in history with a great message. An excellent little read that teaches quite a bit in layers of a historical event, what life was like back then, and to keep dreaming and going forward. <h style="color:#5ABB71;">â˜…</h>

## B is for Baby

*written by Atinuke and illustrated by Angela Brooksbank*

Published 2019. I like how the artwork is loose and textural; you can see the artist's marks in this work. The story is quick and adds a charming tale to an educational book of 'B' words.

## Catch That Chicken!

*written by Atinuke and illustrated by Angela Brooksbank*

Published 2020. Seems like the same universe as this duo's previous book. This story has much more going on, great conflict, and a message that ends excellently. I enjoyed this book and its fun journey through the compound.

## To the Sea

*by Cale Atkinson*

Published 2015. The artwork at the start was very dark, almost too dark to see, but I loved the feeling emitted from the book because of it and the mood it creates as you read the book. The story was a bit long and could be edited to be swifter and more focused, but the message is excellent, and I liked where the ending left us.

## Sled Dog Dachshund

*written by Laura Atkins and illustrated by An Phan*

Published 2016. The art gives this book a vintage feeling, and I would've guessed this book was way older than the publication date. The art is friendly and soft and fits the story's theme well. The story is terrific. I love this message; it reminds me very much of Monster's University and the message that sometimes you can't do what you dream. However, if you keep at it, you can still find that true dream and purpose around that original dream, which is a more vital message and story than the overused, 'you can do anything.'
