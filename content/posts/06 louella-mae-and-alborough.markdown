When a majority of the weeks books a from one author I like to research them a little bit, so here is the Candlewick Profile for Jez Alborough. I really enjoyed what he said about ideas:

> Ideas are like butterflies. <br>
If I chase them, <br>
they will get away. <br>
But if I sit perfectly still, <br>
and I’m lucky, <br>
one might land with a tickle <br>
on my open hand. <br>
Then I just look <br>
as the butterfly opens up its wings <br>
like the pages of a book, <br>
and I think: “Aha! I will <br>
write that book.” <br>
Then the butterfly flies, <br>
leaving me to capture it <br>
between my pages. <br>


## Louella Mae, She's Run Away! 

*by Karen Beaumont Alarcón, illustrations by Rosanne Litzinger*

1997, I enjoyed the artwork in this story, great compositions, and color, all working together to create some vibrant images and great expressions in the characters. The story was very rhythmic, and I liked how the last word of each rhythm jumped to the next page, which gave an excellent page-turn experience. The story could have been more spectacular, but I enjoyed my time. 


## Tall 

*by Jez Alborough*

2005, 15 simple words, tells a sweet story, a mother's eye saves the day in the end. The story can be a starting point for discussing perspectives and differences. The artwork was nicely done. It isn't the kind of art I look at or like, but the pictures are still constructed well and tell a story. This opinion can be said for all the books by Jez Alborough.


## Hug 

*by Jez Alborough*

2000, Another story of little words used, but still conveys a quaint tale of a monkey seeing other animals hug and desiring a hug himself. It reminded me of a more straightforward story of Hug Me by Simon Ciraolo, which came out much later in 2014. It was different, with a similar concept and even different messages to the readers. 


## Hit the Ball Duck 

*by Jez Alborough*

2006, the first spread of this story has more words than Hug and Tall. I immediately enjoy the consistent rhythm in all of Alborough's books. However, this story also has a weird tone with the rhythm, that I need help explaining. However, the flow is unique, something I notice little in current books. Amusing and silly story with a solid ending to wrap it up. It has a graphic novel feel and a great flow of pictures. 


## My Friend Bear 

*by Jez Alborough*

1998, The beginning of the story gives me major deja vu for this story, and having read a very similar story to it by another author. But as the story develops, it diverts in a different direction than the other story (if I remember this book, I will edit this post). A sweet story with the most words by Alborough and a nice message.
