## The Berenstain Bears Don’t Pollute (Anymore)
*By Stan & Jan Berenstain*

Published 1991. The next few weeks will be 100% Berenstain Bears focused as my library had a very well loved and huge selection of Berenstain Bear’s books. I grew up being read these books so they are very nostalgic for me, I think the color style of these books are very influencial in my own choices and taste in color. In general I love the artwork and going forward I will keep my thoughts on the artwork specific to certain elements since overall the Berenstain Bear books are fairly consistent in style and the way they are depicted. I love the style overall and it can’t be said enough on how influential it’s design has been with me and how it inspired a love of picture books in me.

I don’t recall this book, but it so elegantly and succinctly tells a beautiful story on pollution and showcasing the empathy we should have and understanding to think about how our actions affect others, especially in regard to pollution. The text was a bit wordy and at time a little preachy, but I still loved it and it was packed with information that I felt stands the test of time. 
 
## The Berenstain Bears  Bedtime Battle
*By Stan & Jan Berenstain*
Published 2005. 
 
>“Because the great bedtime battle was about to begin!”

As an only child there were never really battles for space and time as unless unfortunate timing struck things were, as I remember, smooth. I do enjoy this story because I feel the realism in the characters, there are distinct personalities and they both work with and against each other that gives the story a sense of ‘realness’. I remember this for many of the Berenstain Bear books, but I always enjoyed its ability to show its readers ‘big’ words that may cause a kid, or even and adult, to question or look up a word or too. I think this story captures the moment and chaotic energy of a full house and the many problems that can arise when living with others, I know I encountered a few of these issues with roommates in college even, a story for any stage of life. I won’t spoil the ending but it’s very sweet and to me happily unexpected. 
 
## The Berenstain Bears and the Bully
*By Stan & Jan Berenstain*

Published 1993. What a ride of a story and maybe a product of its time, I was a bit shocked by where the story took me. I think the ending could’ve been a bit better as it felt rushed and that would’ve made its moral a lot stronger, in its current state it feels a bit lost in its overall story. I do appreciate the stories rawness and ability to respect the reader by telling a story that isn’t sugar coated and the characters may not make the perfect choice. A better ending would’ve enhanced that even more. 
 
## The Berenstain Bears and the Excuse Note
*By Stan & Jan Berenstain*

Published 2001. Simple sweet story, that goes the way you expected it too. I like how it ended with the eventual embracing of gym, but I felt it could’ve been a bit more realistic as the Sister kind of immediately ‘likes’ gym right after Mama gives her a lecture. 
 
## The Berenstain Bears and the Bad Dream
*By Stan & Jan Berenstain*

Published 1988. I immediately loved the cover of this story and the very creative designs throughout; the drawings stand out overall in this book. The first spread does a wonderful job of setting up the story, it is so simple and effective and really gives us an understanding of these characters in a swift spread. The story caught me by surprise on who would have the bad dream, I felt it was a fun simple story, maybe the story could’ve used a bit more in the end of ‘how’ to address bad dreams but I think this was a good introduction to them and allows a child to relate and understand them better just by experiencing them in story.
