## The Day the Stones Walked

*by T.A. Barron, illustrated by William Low*

Published 2007. This story has a great sense of whimsy to it, especially the artwork, good texture and color. In some parts of the story, the text is a bit lengthy. I felt the illustrations could've shown what was being said. Instead, they told me what was happening. A fun story, but a bit long in spots. I'd still probably read it again. 

## Girl Versus Squirrel

*written by Hayley Barrett, illustrated by Renee Andriani*

Published 2020. A story of my own heart, I've been battling a few squirrels at our house too, and I came to the same conclusion as Pearl. The artwork isn't to my typical taste but it was exciting and enjoyable for the story. A nice book. 

## An Excessive Alphabet

*written by Judi Barrett, illustrated by Ron Barrett*

Published 2016. Nostalgic artwork and a very fun and unique take on an ABC book, with a fun activity reveal at the end. 

## It's Great Being a Dad

*by Dan Bar-el, illustrated by Gina Perry*

Published 2017. I probably would've never picked this one up by judging it from the cover, but I'm glad it crossed into my eyes. The story starts unexpectedly and it's a sweet story from beginning to end. 

## Duck, Duck, Moose!

*by Sudipta Bardhan-Quallen, pictures by Noah Z. Jones*

Published 2014. I adored the style of this book, the line work and coloring works well for me. Using only 2 unique words, the story tells itself and does a very nice job of it. Fun from beginning to end with a sweet ending.
