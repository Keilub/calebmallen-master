## Dragon and Captain

*Written by P.R. Allabach, illustrated by Lucas Turnbloom*

Published 2015. The artwork isn’t to my taste, but it is done well. The book is also laid out like a graphic novel, so it’s like a child’s first visual novel experience, which is neat. The visual novel style has been quite prominent in recent years. Watching it bleed into picture books and other ranges/types of books has been interesting. This book starts immediately with storytelling; I had to return from page one as I did not catch it at first look. A very adventurous tale and quite fun to read. Loved the dynamic of switching back and forth between imaginative and reality.


## Quiet

*By Kate Alizadeh*

Published 2017. A story about the sounds around us; I wish there would have been a stronger story element to fully bring everything together but still a nice and simple story of listening and hearing all the sounds around us. The artwork was done well but could have been more varied with the compositions.


## Miss Nelson is Missing

*By James Marshall*

Published 1977. I remember this one from when I was younger. Immediately noticed the difference in the paper and loved the tactile feel of the older paper. It brings back memories. I love the artwork, and the simple color washes over detailed linework. Great message and story, and an even better twist at the end. I could be biased as I have fond memories of this story, but I love this book.


## Miss Nelson is Back

*By James Marshall*

Published 1982. I just found out there was a sequel or more books about Miss Nelson. I was excited to pull this one out. This is hilarious; it bore the kids to tears; such a silly concept. Another fun story in the universe that is Miss Nelson. The first book still holds a special place, and the original has a better message, but this one is worth reading.


## Dancing in the Wings

*By Debbie Allen, pictures by Kadir Nelson*

Published 2000. Incredible artwork and such a lovely cover. I was astonished this book was so old. It feels very modern in its design and style. The story has quite the word count; I wish it was edited for a swifter read, but it would be a good book for transitioning to more text-focused books, and this one is written very well. A lovely message with absolutely stunning artwork, a must-read.
