## I Ain't Gonna Paint No More!
*by Karen Beaumont, illustrated by David Catrow*

Published 2005. The expressive and vibrant artwork fits the mood and text of the story perfectly. It includes subtle additions not mentioned in the text. The story is fun and sweet and is relatable to both parents and children. 
 
## Rosie Revere, Engineer
*by Andrea Beaty, illustrated by David Roberts*

Published 2013. Immediately loved the modern vintage style of the artwork. A lovely balance of linework and simple blocked colors underneath. The text is very rhythmic and has a great flow to it that makes reading it quite enjoyable. The story wears its moral on its sleeve. It's very upfront, but it works. It's a great, whimsical, fantastical tale. An especially perfect book for that child who loves to build. <h style="color:#E7A526;">★</h>
 
## Ada Twist, Scientist
by Andrea Beaty, illustrated by David Roberts*

Published 2016. Same great art as this book seems to be a part of a series. The text had more great flow to it and was easy to read. The story left me a bit bittersweet at the end. It focused too much on the parent, resulting in not much character development. We saw so much more character development in the previous book that I liked. 
 
## Iggy Peck, Architect
*by Andrea Beaty, illustrated by David Roberts*

Published 2007. Again, the same great artwork holds true. The text wasn't as easily read but it was still a delight to read with wonderful word selection. The arc of the story is equally fantastic as we get to the end of the tale. <h style="color:#E7A526;">★</h>
 
## Building Our House
*by Jonathan Bean*

Published 2013. I liked the color choices and the artwork had a charm to it of abstract wash and organic linework. The book is somewhat text-heavy and long. I enjoyed the story, which is about building a house and its relation to community and family.
