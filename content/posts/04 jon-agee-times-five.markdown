## Dmitri the Astronaut
*by Jon Agee* <br>
"It was just before dawn when Dmitri touched down in the Atlantic Ocean."

A quick read that left me wanting more. Sweet message that could’ve been punched up some with more story for a bigger impact for the theme of the story, about how only the opinions that we have friendship and connection with are the ones that we should treasure most. It’s not about a stranger’s ‘love’ and ‘admiration’ but those that we are connected with in friendship and connection in general. Lovely artwork, which I can say for all of Agee’s books I’ve read is that the artwork is so fun and a real pleasure to look at.

Words: Intergalactic, Naturalist


## I want a Dog
*by Jon Agee* <br>
"Welcome to Happydale Animal Shelter."

Very silly and very swift, simple story with a great ending that I didn’t totally expect and I’m glad the writer took a chance not giving the reader what was expected. Lovely message overall.

Word: Slither


## Life on Mars
*by Jon Agee* <br>
"I am on Mars."

Love this one very much! Super fun and silly, where the illustrations tell one thing visually and the text tells another, I can already hear the laughs this story would get in a classroom or during bedtime.

Phrase: "No way! It’s life!”


## Lion Lessons
*by Jon Agee* <br>
"It’s not easy getting your lion diploma."

Creative and simple overall, this story had the best opening sentence. The story is very strong and stays focused and fun as we see the main character fail and fail but in the end succeeds in a unique way that is well worth the pay off to be a lion. Displays a Childs creative thinking very well. Loved this one very much, and was the story I mentioned early that I have used as inspiration in a story I am currently writing.

Word: Gnash


## Milo’s Hat Trick
*by Jon Agee* <br>
"He was called Milo the magnificent!"

Funny start and immediately wanted to read more just from the first page. Almost reads like a classic fable, very creative. This one really shows off the silliness that Agee can convey with his illustrations. This story had some complex storytelling that took multiple view points and arcs that all come together into the ending, which is a great ending that twist our expectations. Very well structured and told.

Phrase: “Something I learned from a bear.”

## In closing <br>
When I pulled the 5 books from the shelf this week and realized they were all from one writer/illustrator I was a little bummed but Jon Agee crafts some incredible books that were an absolute joy to read. See you next week!
