## Dear Peter Rabbit
*by Alma Flor Ada, pictures by Leslie Tryon* <br>
"Have I got news for you."

I liked the layout of the spreads with each page having a letter from one of the characters, but the story overall was ‘lost’ and quite wordy with details I really didn’t care about and unnecessary in my opinion. It’s obvious very quickly that these characters are from Goldilocks and the Three Bears, Peter Rabbit, and The Three Little Pigs, as the text spends a little too much time on talking about those stories. I do like the ‘world buildings’ aspect of this story in giving us details around those other stories within this story. The art is very vintage or classic feeling, which makes sense as this book is a few decades old at this point.

Words that stood out to me: eucalyptus, forbidden, raccoon


## Bird Hugs
*by Ged Adamson* <br>
"Bernard wasn’t like the other birds."

Immediately enjoyed the sideways text, and there are a few instances of playing with the text later in the book, I still wish it would’ve done it more. I absolutely loved this book and story (my only gripe being the cover and title giving too much away in my opinion, they should hint but not just bonk the reader over the head with the answer.) It’s a very silly and heartwarming book. Laughs are abundant, one involving a worm that was very sweet. The story, just WOW. I loved the way it directed me one directions that I felt was obvious to then go another direction that was a perfect ending along with the message of the story, of friendship and belonging. The art is also spectacular, I wish it would’ve moved my eye and been a bit more varied in how it was paced but overall the illustrations are packed with details and fantastic colors. Very well done.

Words that stood out to me: groan, embarrassed


## Shark Dog and the School Trip Rescue!
*by Ged Adamson* <br>
"You won’t met any pets like shark dog."

Another book from Ged Adamson, this book was published before the previous book (above). The artwork is still fantastic, I have definitely found a new inspiration artistically with the colors and way Ged utilizes textures and line with a very expressive touch. The cover of this book was my favorite of this batch, very vibrant and silly. This story wasn't as strong as the book above, the ending felt very rushed and very lacking, the way it ends doesn’t even feel necessary. If it was left out nothing would be lost, and that isn’t what I want in an ending. I also hoped the story would’ve went in a more whimsical or silly direction with how the early book is setup. With that said it is still a very fun book and quite creative.

Phrase that stood out to me: “♫ ♪ We like to go a-wandering. ♪ ♫ ”


## Douglas, You Need Glasses!
*by Ged Adamson*
"Nancy anuglas were chasing squirrels."

And once again another Ged Adamson book, this one the earliest one published from the three stories I read by him. The story is very straightforward with quite a few great funny moments, especially the eye chart part of the book… I can already hear children giggling up a storm from this section of the book. This one is a great option for a child that has just learned they need glasses and maybe aren’t too jazzed about that idea.

Words that stood out to me: nearsighted, disaster


## Love Is.

*by Diane Adams, pictures by Claire Keane* <br>
"Love inholding something fragile, tiny wings and head down."

I really love the poetic writing in this story along with its message (very similar to Love You Forever), but with that said I think it leans too heavily towards adults. The colors and artwork are my favorite part of this book, the palette is a personal favorite and works incredibly well with the expressive and raw line work.
