## A Most Unusual Lunch 
*by Robert Bender*

Published 1994. Simply put, it's phenomenal artwork. Love the color and textures that pairs perfectly with the unique and stylistic characters on top of the perfectly composed spreads. A feast for my eyes! The story is a fun way to learn some numbers and let the creativity flow as the creatures pickup characteristics of what they just ate. The ending is a sly twist that left me with a big grin. <h style="color:#E7A526;">★</h>
 
## Madeline 
*by Ludwig Bemelmans*

Published 1939. Very familiar with this book already, a huge fan of the artwork, pick it up just for that, and then be treated to an equally lovely story. The story seems like it could've been inspiration for Tomi Ungerer as it gave me similiar vibes to his way with stories as things continue to build and happen and we cope and go through joy and sad. A great, great book for anyone. <h style="color:#E7A526;">★</h>
 
## Madeline and the Cats of Rome
*by John Bemelmans Marciano*

Published 2008. The artwork is similiar but doesn't capture that same gesture and energy of Ludwig Bemelmans. The story misses the target on what made the original so impactful and heartfelt but this book still has a story worth a read. 
 
## Itty Bitty
*by Cece Bell*

Published 2009. I love the artwork, especially the color choices as they jumped off the pages. The story was engaging but it led to nothing as the end just ends. 
 
## All of the Factors of Why I Love Tractors
*by Davina Bell, illustrated by Jenny Lovlie*

Published 2021. A modern vintage style of artwork that is a blast to look at. Adored how the story perfectly captures that intense infatuation that can overcome a child when they are 'into' something. I remember being obsessed with many things and they were always changing. I would've loved if the ending would've played off that as it did in the earlier parts of the story and left us with our main character side eyeing something else. This book has lots of any aged reader to enjoy.
