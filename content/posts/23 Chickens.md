## Peeping Beauty

*by Mary Jane Auch*

Published 1993. It's the best story I've read from Auch yet; the artwork is charming and nicely done, but it could be more varied. The story's message is lighter-handed than some of Auch's other works, which creates a more dynamic and engaging story.

## Poultrygeist

*by Mary Jane Auch*

Published 2003. The art style is different; the artwork looks to be more digitally created in this book. The story was a simple scary story, and would be an excellent read during the fall/Halloween season. Overall the story dragged on and felt too long for what was there.

## The Buk Buk Festival

*by Mary Jane and Herm Auch*

Published 2015. A very different look visually than previous works by Auch; I preferred some of the tactile and charm of the earlier artworks. The story is a bit silly, but I still tried to stay to reality when I wish it would've gone a bit more silly and creative.

## Chickerella

*by Mary Jane and Herm Auch*

Published 2005. This artwork is fascinating; it is a collage of photographs and puppets, and digital renderings of color and line, and it is unique and enjoyable. Like the other books, the text is long and large parts of the text are unnecessary for the story. A relatively standard retheming of Cinderella, it tries a different ending that didn't work for me and confused things a bit.

## The Easter Egg Farm

*by Mary Jane Auch*

Published 1992. Same as most of Auch's books; not a particular fan, but they are all 'ok' books.
