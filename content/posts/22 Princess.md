## Bunnies!!!

*by Kevan Atteberry*

Published 2015. Straightforward artwork that could use some more variation in compositions and layout to tell the story better. The story was also simple, with a subtle messageâ€”a very 'ok' book.

## Puddles!!!

*by Kevan Atteberry*

Published 2016. It is a follow-up to the above book, but not much of a message or story in the book. These types of books just are different from what I'm looking for or desiring from picture books; these books are too simple.

## Princess Prunella and the Purple Peanut

*written by Margaret Atwood and illustrated by Maryann Kovalski*

Published 1995. First thing first, I love the title of this book; fascinating and piqued my interest immediately. With the text, this seems more like a transition book from picture books to chapter books, very text-focused and long-form for a picture book. This long text makes the device of 'P' words exhausting; if the text were cut back and left to show more vs. tell the reader, then the device of 'P' word alliteration would be more enjoyable. The story's content was creative and pleasant and gave off a fable/fairytale vibe, which I liked. The story's message could be better developed; I didn't particularly appreciate that the only reason the princess does good deeds is ultimately for her gain. With this much story and text, the princess has plenty of time to grow and initiate a good deed beyond just for herself, even if the story, by the end, has the princess doing good deeds without the peanut around. Overall a heartfelt tale that stumbled in places but is worth the read.

## Eggs Mark the Spot

*by Mary Jane Auch*

Published 1996. The story was creative and silly, slowed down at points, and the ending was predictable, with little of a message. The story has a few small moments where a message can almost peak through but overall just a silly romp at the museum with a chicken's interesting egg laying.

## Hen Lake

*by Mary Jane Auch*

Published 1995. I liked the simplicity of color and texture in the artwork. The story came across as very preachy to me and hit you over the head with a message; it could've been more subtle and been a more intereseting book for it.
