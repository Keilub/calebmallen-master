## In a Blue Room 

*written by Jim Averbeck and illustrations by Tricia Tusa*

Published 2008. A book where the pictures are perfect with the text and story. Absolutely a grand book and a subtle and charming message. Read this one as soon as possible. Magical. <h style="color:#E7A526;">★</h>

## Hope

*by Corrinne Averiss and Sebastien Pelon*

Published 2019. The art is fantastic in this and works back and forth with the text nicely. The story is well written and very sweet, and the message is there and good. It is predictable and maybe needs to be for a picture book of this type, but I'm curious if there is a version of this story where we don't see the dog return; we see a different reality but also remain hopeful and grateful for the moments our main character spoke of and enjoyed; a great book and a great read, just curious on other possibilities.

## Joy

*by Corrinne Averiss and Isabelle Follath*

Published 2018. Nice illustrations and written well, a little wordy in spots. The message is good but undercuts a bit in the end; I enjoyed the parts where joy can't be caught or put into some 'item' or 'object.' Overall a good read and overall gets to a 'true' meaning of joy, where we can find it, and how we experience it.

## Love

*by Corrinne Averiss and Kirsti Beautyman*

Published 2020. Excellent illustrations and a variety of types are utilized in this book. The story was poetic, which worked well, and I liked the imagery it evoked. This story touches on a few themes, does them well, and nicely weaves them together.

## What Will You Be, Sara Mee?

*written by Kate Aver Avraham and illustrations by Anne Sibley O'Brien*

Published 2010. I enjoyed the freeness of the pictures and some of the linework conflicts, but overall the artwork has charm. The story is a bit wordy and very long for a picture book, but I enjoyed all the new words and culture it shares with the reader.
