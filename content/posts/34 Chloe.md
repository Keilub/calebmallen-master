## Cow Boy is not a Cowboy

*by Gregory Barrington*

Published 2020. The story was interesting, but not to my taste. The art was well done. The story was engaging, but a bit basic and forced in spots. 

## Chloe and the Lion

*written by Mac Barnett, pictures by Adam Rex.* 

Published 2012. Incredibly unique visuals that were interesting and lovely to look at. The story is very meta and breaks the fourth wall. This would be hilarious to a child because it was hilarious to me. What I enjoy about this book is its respect for the child and adult readers, it tells a story for anyone. Truly a creative tale. <h style="color:#E7A526;">★</h>

## Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs

*written by Judi Barrett, drawn by Ron Barrett*

Published 1978. Very fond memories of this book. Nostalgic. The artwork is incredible. The text is long but the choice of words creates such a fantastic adventure through a silly tale. For sure read this fun and well drawn book. <h style="color:#E7A526;">★</h>

## Planet of the Pies: Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 3

*written by Judi Barret, drawn by Isidre Mones*

Published 2013. It's more of the same, even with a different illustrator the pictures are a wonderful delight. 

## Count the Monkeys

*by Mac Barnet and Kevin Cornell*

Published 2013. A fantastic twist on the counting book format. The artwork pops off the page with excitement and color. The story is interesting and engaging. Read this!
