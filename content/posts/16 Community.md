## Lost. Found.

*written by Diane Arnold and illustrated by Matthew Cordell*

Published 2015. I am familiar with Matthew Cordell's illustrations and a huge fan; I love his work and always look forward to anything he creates. This book does not disappoint! The story pairs so well with the illustrations, and the simplicity of the text of just using two words works so well for the message and theme of the book. There is lovely energy and character just oozing from this book that comes together with a warming message. Great book, do yourself a favor and check it out! <h style="color:#5ABB71;">★</h>

## May I Come In?

*written by Marsha Diane Arnold and illustrated by Jennie Poh*

Published 2018. The illustrations are done well, but not particularly to my taste. I enjoyed the story and was surprised by how it developed to the ending. Once our main character found a house with room, the hesitation was a charming touch. Overall a decent book.

## Waiting for Snow

*written by Marsha Diane Arnold and illustrated by Renata Liwska*

Published 2016. Great and unique artwork. The story is well done with lots of very charming touches that give the story character and depth. Another great book to read with a message that doesn't overwhelm a reader; it provides the reader with space to enjoy the text and illustrations.

## Are you a Cheeseburger?

*by Monica Arnaldo*

Published 2021. Fantastic illustrations that pair well with the text. I loved the message and silliness of the story, and it developed well to the end. I'm curious what this book would read with a bit less narration and more showing or dialogue to get its story across. Overall the book is creative, and I think both children and adults will love the story and message of this book. <h style="color:#5ABB71;">★</h>

## Pizza

*by Frank Asch*

Published 2015. The style of illustrations wasn't for me, but it was varied, and the compositions were nice. The color was unique and gave a nostalgic feel that I did enjoy. The text was simple and easy to read, but I'm still determining how I feel about the story. It was creative, but it could've also been pushed further. A bit more conflict could've seen this story flourish, or making it end in an unpredictable place would help. It was still an enjoyable read, but I wanted a little more from it overall.
