## Camille and the Sunflowers

*by Laurence Anholt*

Published 1994. Another good introduction to an artist uniquely and creatively by adding a story to the art and showcasing it well.

## No, No, Gnome!

*by Ashlyn Anstee*

Published 2016. Nice artwork and a decent story, but the message could've been more impactful if it had more to say about Gnome's antics and how the kids responded beyond them just ignoring him after his three antics.

## Hedge Hog!

*by Ashlyn Anstee*

Published 2018. Maybe I have some Hedge Hog in me, but I was not fond of this story much. It ignores the feelings of Hedge Hog at the start and that he likes to be alone, and ultimately his home is destroyed by his clutches and then forced to live in a community that he just all of a sudden loves now. We strive with a community but to differing degrees. The message could be better.

## Betty goes bananas

*by Steve Antony*

Published 2014. The artwork has great charm and style, very interesting and fun to look at. It captures how adults think children act, which may be both accurate and inaccurate. Overall it captures a piece of the idea that a child has of simply wanting to do something themselves, even though this book doesn't say much about that idea, which could've been quite unique. The story is simple, with a very light message, if any at all.

## Are We There, Yeti?

*by Ashlyn Anstee*

Published 2015. I enjoyed the art, and the story is simply a tale of a road trip to a new place; the Yeti pun is used a lot; I wish it would've been used more creatively.
