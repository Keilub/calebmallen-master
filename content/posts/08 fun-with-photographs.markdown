An interesting week of books, first time we encounter a book with photographs as opposed to illustrations. Also, if you have read any of these books, feel free to leave a comment of your thoughts as well.

## Sheep, Sheep, Sheep, Help Me Fall Asleep

*By Arlene Alda*

Published 1992. No drawings in this book but very silly and fun images. The story is written with great flow. Every line is easy to read and pairs with the next. I loved this because it feels like my mind is constantly bouncing and roaming to different ideas when I want to focus on one. The mind in the story eventually finds the sheep, starts to count, gets sleepy, and ends with a cute little line/twist. I really liked this and was surprised by how much I enjoyed this story. There is something fun and unique about the photographs, unlike if this story had been illustrated.


## Pig, Horse, or Cow, Don't Wake Me Now

(a companion to Sheep, Sheep, Sheep, Help Me Fall Asleep)

*By Arlene Alda*

Published 1994, A sequel to Sheep, Sheep, Sheep. Nice photos. What I like about this story is it feels like you can't read this before bed (I mean, you could), but this story would be a great one to read as you wake up for the day, a silly start to the waking up process. I liked this one, but I did like Sheep, Sheep, Sheep, and much more.


## Little Big Boubo

*By Beatrice Alemagna*

Published 2014. Very unique illustrations that I really liked. The story itself wasn't my favorite, but there wasn't necessarily anything wrong with it. A simple story that ends with a parent's love. When I picked up the book, I bet the book was a lot older than 2014, just from the style and look of the book, which was my biggest surprise learning.


## Behold the Trees

*By Sue Alexander & Leonid Gore*

Published 2001. Thank goodness the typeface used on the first spread was not used throughout the book. Very hard to read. I loved the illustrations. The story is a biblical timeline of events, very wordy; overall, I did not finish the book. There are no issues with biblical stories in general; I wish this story had more to hold my interest. The story tries to tell an in-depth account or too much information when there are ways for this story to be told quicker and more interestingly.


## Push Button

*By Aliki*

Published 2010. Immediately disappointed there were not any buttons to push for me to engage physically with the book itself. But the story is fun, and the words are vibrant with action and noise. This story works for children and parents as it's relatable to both and is fun. I also liked the art and color; they were exciting.

Thank you for stopping by and reading with me this week,
