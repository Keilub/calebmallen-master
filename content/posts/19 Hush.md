## Clovis Keeps His Cool,

*written by Katelyn Aronson and illustrated by Eve Farb*

Published 2021. I enjoyed the artwork, and I wish there were more full-spread illustrations to engulf me in the book. The story was pleasant but a bit predictable. The story tries to say a few too many things, and the impact is lost if it had more focus on one.

## The Fort That Jack Built

*written by Boni Ashburn and illustrated by Brett Helquist*

Published 2013. I loved the color scheme and textures of the artwork. The text had a nice rhythm, but the story ended weak. There was a lot of conflict and good build-up, and I hoped for a better ending that would've put good use to the child's grand imagination.

## A Twin is to Hug

*written by Boni Ashburn and illustrated by John Nez*

Published 2019. The art was a beautiful mashup that felt like vintage gouache but modern; it was lovely. The story was charming and great for any parent with twins. Yet, in the end, I am left wanting more from the story, more conflict, more truth. The story would've benefited from more abstract elements of what it may mean to be a twin, even the things that aren't pleasant. Reading this story, I got hints of Ruth Krauss but longed for those truthful and raw moments we'd see in a Krauss book that this book is missing.

## Hush, Little Dragon

*written by Boni Ashburn and illustrated by Kelly Murphy*

Published 2008. What an odd book at first glance because the greens on the cover and oranges inside, when looked at individually, aren't the most beautiful of colors. However, the artwork has a definitive beauty and charm because of the colors utilized. The story is a nice re-theme of 'Mama's Gonna Buy You A Mockingbird.' I found it enjoyable and what I expected to the end.

## I Had a Favorite Hat

*written by Boni Ashburn and illustrated by Robyn Ng*

Published 2015. The artwork is good, but not to my taste. The story was quite wordy, and it could be edited down. I enjoyed the multiple uses of the hat, and the ending was a bit unexpected, which was nice.
