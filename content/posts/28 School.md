## No Such Thing

*by Ella Bailey*

Published 2014. The color choices for this book are mesmerizing, a blend of vintage and modern. Also, the drawings are fantastic, with various compositions and subtle textures. I like the unique and tranquil message. The book is the perfect read for Halloween.

## One Day on Our Blue Planet in the Savannah

*by Ella Bailey*

Published 2015. More lovely artwork from Ella Bailey. The story was different from my taste but is well told, and there is much to learn about the Savannah here.

## Tiny Pie

*written by Mark Bailey and Michael Oatman and illustrations by Edward Hemingway*

Published 2013. The drawings were fun and varied. The story fell flat for me; I wish there were something to excite or interest me here. The message it is attempting is lovely, but in the end, it is predictable.

## This is our Baby, Born Today

*written by Varsha Bajaj and illustrations by Eliza Wheeler*

Published 2016. Lovely artwork that is a joy to view. It is varied and engaging in composing the picture and directing the eye around the page. A good book for parents of a newborn.

## Stanley at School

*written by Linda Bailey and illustrations by Bill Slavin*

Published 2015. I love the texture and layers of the illustrations and the marks made. The compositions are nicely laid out, with variety throughout the book. The text is a bit wordy, but this would be an excellent book for those getting ready to go to School for the first time. <h style="color:#5ABB71;">â˜…</h>
