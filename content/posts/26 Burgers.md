## What a Lucky Day!

*by Jashar Awan*

Published 2020. The artwork is different from my taste, but it is well done, and the compositions have a nice variety. The story is fun, and I liked its unique take and message.

## Pigs Will Be Pigs,

*written by Amy Axelrod and illustrations by Sharon McGinly-Nally*

Published 1994. The artwork is fun and energetic. The story is a sly way to incorporate math and numbers and is very well done, and even has a subtle message in the end.

## The Burger and the Hotdod

*written by Jim Aylesworth and illustrations by Stephen Gammell*

Published 2001. I adore the work of Stephen Gammell, so this book is such a blast to look at just for the illustrations. Its drawings are smile-inducing, wacky, and just an absolute delight. This book is a collection of food-based silly stories that range from jokes to nonsense and, at times, thought-provoking. I love the variety and the illustrations. <h style="color:#E7A526;">★</h>

## Cock-a-doodle-doo, Creak, Pop-pop, Moo

*written by Jim Aylesworth and illustrations by Brad Sneed*

Published 2012. I also enjoy Brad Sneed's work, so I enjoy this book. This story is written superbly, and I love the lyrical and musical way it reads quickly. Each word used has real thought and choice, and it is a real treat and joy to read. There needs to be a stronger message but the 'day-in-the-life' vibe and feel of the book is lovely and well worth the read.

## The Mitten

*Retold by Jim Ayleswroth and illustrations by Barbara McClintock*

Published 2009. The artwork is charming and fits the theme and story exceptionally well. The story itself is absurd, delightful, and funny. There is a message here without directly telling you, which is lovely and makes for a perfect bedtime read. <h style="color:#E7A526;">★</h>
