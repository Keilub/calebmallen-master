## Unplugged

*by Steve Antony*

Published 2017. I liked the simplicity of the art and story. It captures the balance and dynamic of the great things being 'plugged' in can accomplish and being 'unplugged'—a good read.

## Bunnies on the Bus

*by Philip Ardagh and Ben Mantle*

Published 2019. I like the artwork; it is very dynamic and captures much of the fun going on in the story. Some of the choices for repetitious phrases and words weren't doing much for the story, and it could've been cut and just as fun and whimsical while being more streamlined. I liked the silliness of the bunnies, and at moments reminded me of Bears by Ruth Krauss, which is why I wish the text in Bunnies on the Bus were sparse because the illustrations can tell us so much along with our imagination.

## Max Attacks

*by Kathi Appelt and Penelope Dullaghan*

Published 2019. Maybe I'm biased, but I enjoyed this; it reminded me of my cat too much. I liked following the cat and its mischievous attacks. I'm glad the writer chose to keep with the fish as it creates a nice dynamic and returns in the story that ends slyly. Very, very good artwork that pairs well with the very flowing and vibrant text; if I were to change anything, the text could sometimes describe too much that could be covered by illustrations that would've created an enhanced back-and-forth dynamic of words and pictures.

## Daniel's Good Day

*by Micha Archer*

Published 2019. The artwork is so unique, and the paring of cut paper with what looks like pastels is very clever and incredibly eye-catching. I am mesmerized by the art. The story is a good message, and I feel it could've been significantly enhanced with some struggle or something that would showcase someone attempting to have a good day in the middle of some adverse. The text could be paired back, letting the illustrations show what doesn't need to be said.

## Daniel Finds a Poem 

*by Micha Archer*

Published 2016. A stunning book with a tremendous and thought-provoking message. All things are working so well in this book. Please read it. <h style="color:#5ABB71;">★</h>
