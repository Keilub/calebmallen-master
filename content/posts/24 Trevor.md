## Monkey Brother

*by Adam Auerbach*

Published 2017. The artwork was simplistic and nicely done; I wish some of the emotional scenes had more to them, but overall the art was fascinating. The story is a quick and simple read with a relatable message; overall very nice.

## One Word from Sophia

*by Jim Averbeck and Yasmeen Ismail*

Published 2015. I liked the art style and colors used, and it was bright and engaging. The story was simple and unique; I hadn't read many like this before. The message and ending were a little predictable for me, but for the intended audience, it would be a great introduction to manners and other words (as there are quite a few big words in this story, with a glossary).

## Trevor

*written by Jim Averbeck and illustrated by Amy Hevron*

Published 2018. The story balances the art and text well, and I loved how the artwork enhanced this story. The message and text are also genuine and done with great skill. The story is thought-provoking and sweet; overall a very unique tale that you should read! <h style="color:#5ABB71;">â˜…</h>

## Rescue Squad No.9

*by Mike Austin*

Published 2016. The artwork has excellent color and texture and is very impactful and strong. The story is of little words; the book could even remove the words it has and be a wordless book. Simple and easy to follow of a rescue on water and water safety.

## Junkyard

*by Mike Austin*

Published 2014. More lovely artwork from Austin; I especially enjoyed the junk yard's textures and bits and bobs. Not a strong message in this book, but it is a sweet tale of cleaning up and working and then creating and playing.
