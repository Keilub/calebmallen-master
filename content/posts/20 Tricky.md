## Monkey Tricks

*by Camilla Ashforth*

Published 1992. The artwork is warm and quaint, and I wish it were more varied in certain spots. The story was alright; not much of a message and a bit sporadic.

## The Whopper

*by Rebecca Ashdown*

Published 2015. I love this book's cover; strong and striking in color and line. The art throughout the book is visually jumping and a pleasure to the eye. To nitpick, I would've liked to see more varied perspectives and compositions. The story's premise is excellent; I wish some of the events were up to the same standard set with this silly and creative start. The text gets a bit preachy in spots where it isn't necessary; the story and message can speak for themselves as an undertone and still be plenty strong.

## Stella's Dancing Days

*written by Sandy Asher and illustrated by Kathryn Brown*

Published 2001. An excellent introduction to a few ballet words. The story/text is written well, but I wish that it led to a conclusion that was a bit more interesting.

## Chicken Story Time

*written by Sandy Asher and illustrated by Mark Fearing*

Published 2016. The artwork, at times, looks like stills from a cartoon which I enjoy; the compositions and layout need more variation. A unique story with this feeling of absurdity that is quite lovely, but I wished for more after I had closed the book; this story needs more story.

## Bob and Flow

*by Rebecca Ashdown*

Published 2014. Charming and straightforward illustrations. I love the colors being used and the unrestricted linework that meanders along to form the characters and environments. The story was disjointed from the visuals, and the book was sometimes confusing because of this.
