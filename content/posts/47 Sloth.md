## Journey
*by Aaron Becker*

Published 2013. Pick this one up for the art alone. I typed that just from the first spread... not realizing this was a wordless picture book. Stunning illustrations that tell a beautiful story. The illustrations reveal the whimsical and mysterious ways of the world. They give me hints of Alice in Wonderland. Such a fun, fun book! <h style="color:#5ABB71;">★</h>
 
## Quest
*by Aaron Becker*

Published 2014. Was happy to see there were more books in the series. Stunning artwork, the story isn't as impactful as the first but it is still fantastic. 
 
## Return
*by Aaron Becker*

Published 2016. Seems to be the last in this trilogy and spectacularly drawn books. This story was better than the second but the first book is a must-pick-up!
 
## A Library Book for Bear
*by Bonny Becker, illustrated by Kady MacDonald Denton*

Published 2014. Lovely artwork with such a charming touch. I relate to Bear so quickly. Growing up, I always tried to find 'everything I need' in one simple place. I didn't want to seek anything else. I tried to convince myself I already had everything. I'm glad Bear (and I) found so much more to seek and wander. But with the text of the book itself, it was fun and a good read. The ending didn't feel fully connected though, and I really hoped it had stuck the landing a bit better. 
 
## Sloth at the Zoom
*by Helaine Becker and Orbie*

Published 2018. The textures and colors of the artwork are fantastic! I really enjoyed the variety in the illustrations as well. The story was a great balance of silly and heartfelt with a very heartwarming ending to match. <h style="color:#5ABB71;">★</h>
