## And the Train Goes...
*by William Bee*

Published 2007. The artwork is unique and very original, I loved it because it isn't the artwork I typically seek out and this style by Wiliiam Bee is fun, bright and full of detail. The colors are fantastic and everything visually really clicks. The story is simple as it begins and then we get to the fun and silliness of the riders and their rhyming text throughout the book with a fun and simple ending. An easy to read and beautiful book. No real message in the book, but I don't think it necessarily needs one for what it accomplishes already. 
 
## Pierre in the Air!
*by Andrea Beck*

Published 2011. The artwork was well done, I was a bit puzzled on some of the choices on how/what was shown from the text. For example close ot the end, the choice not to show the newspaper article was a bit dissapointing, that would've been cute and fun to see, the proof of our micheveous deeds. The story/text was pretty straightforward and sweet, but not much left to come back to once finished. A decent book that I enjoyed. 
 
## A Bedtime for Bear
*by Bonny Becker, illustrated by Kady MacDonald Denton*

Published 2010. Another book from our Bear that thought they did not need the library, same artwork that is pleasant. A very fun bed time story. I wish some of the illustrations would've been pushed a bit further to showcase the mouses 'loud' antics but overall everything was great about this book.
 
## Grandma According to Me
*by Karen Magnuson Beil, illustrated by Ted Rand*

Published 1992. Vintage watercolor artwork vibe from this one. Love the visuals. The story is sweet and told from a child about their grandma and all the things a grandma is 'known for', I did like how the text was poetic and mysterious at times with what it was saying and lefts the reader to fill in the gaps and stories of the wrinkles and stories from grandma. The book had a strong theme of memory and made me very aware of the present. 
 
## Robert and the World's Best Cake
*by Anne-Kathrin Behl*

Published 2020. The colors were to die for in this book, captivating pastel colors, and detailed and engaging artwork overall. The story left me a bit unsatisfied, the ending kind of just was all of a sudden there and over. They bake a cake, and everyone comes and then they need to make a bigger cake and then it is kind of just over.
