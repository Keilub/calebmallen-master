## Bringing the Rains to Kapiti Plain <br>
*by Verna Aardema, pictures by Beatriz Vidal* <br>
"This is the great Kapita Plain”

I was already familiar with this book, I remember my 1st or 2nd grade teacher reading this to us, as well as this being a book that was a part of the Reading Program at our Elementary School, where we could read books and take quizzes to gain points. This book has a very strong rhythm and repetitious writing to it. I enjoy the way the writing builds and really becomes musical, but as we read further into the story the text does dominate some spreads which is bittersweet in the sense that sometimes I was skipping through the writing because it was just repeating so much but also I did enjoy the writing. I don’t notice many books with this sort of writing style much anymore, but that could very easily be because of my personal taste and attention for other types of books. The illustrations in this book are really well done and interesting. I love the flatly drawn elements with textures and the absence of a typical drawn line. Overall this was a great book and I’d recommend it for a home library.

Words that stood out to me: stork, belated, little ki-pat


## Ready or Not, Here Comes Scout!
*by Jill Abrasion & Jane O’Connor, pictures by Deborah Melmon* <br>
"Hello! My name is Scout, and this is baby, my best friend in the world."

At first glance I totally judged this book by its cover as a book I’d never pick up and read. I was honestly surprised, went in directions that caught me off guard at times and while it does ultimately do what is expected it went about it in an unexpected way which was a very nice surprise. I really liked the overall message of how to be a friend and how different friends require different things in their relationships as a friend and that some are on different levels of friendship, which is a really important thing to learn and develop as young as possible to best be equipped to socialize and create loving and lasting friendships. The artwork was nice as well, has a very nostalgia feel for me, but also a very visually sweet book that isn’t my preferred style. This is a very solid book.

Words that stood out to me: growls (because it only shows up once in a story about dogs.)


## Quacky Baseball

"Opening day, and thumby Duckling is nervous."

Immediately loved the cover, the expression cracks me up. I do love the technique the illustrator is using, overall the artwork is great with lots of great scenes to look at. There isn’t much story here, it basically is just a story of the final inning of a baseball game, our main character (or ‘hero’) isn’t really tested or changed in the story, but this book would be perfect for that young baseball loving child that’s obsessed. Not much story but a good one to check out in the library for the artwork, some funny names, and baseball inning drama.

## Train
*by Judi Abbot* <br>
"Little elephant loved trains."

What I noticed right away were the lovely illustrations and colors. Utilized repetition but different than Bringing the Rain to Kapiti Plain, a single word vs entire sentences/phrases. The biggest thing I did not like about this book is Elephant at one point throws a big tantrum on a spread and it isn’t addressed. An event happens and none of the characters address the tantrum, there is change in Elephant but it doesn’t feel earned development. I think the intended message is good and there in pieces, in playing and sharing with others, but it doesn’t fully work as a cohesive story progression.

Words that stood out to me: tunnel


## Who’s on First?
*by Abbott & Costello, pictures by John Martz* <br>
"Hiya Abbot!"

In reading this I realized I had never actually watched the original Abbott & Costello comedy routine this book is sharing. I know about the routine mostly because it’s been used/referenced in many other pieces of media, but had never watched the original. With that said this book is absolutely hysterical, I was holding back laughter in the library, a very silly book. My biggest gripe is that it sorta just ends, the story doesn’t really develop, and there isn’t really any change or resolve but then again not all stories need that, this is just a fun silly time, and honestly I think any parent or child could eventually come to conclusion of the problem and gather some sort of ‘theme’ from the story itself. If you know the comedy source then you know this book already, and it’s perfect for children (and adults). The art isn’t my cup of tea but it’s executed well and the colors and visual movement is very nice, lots of variety in the spreads to create a nice pacing of the story as it builds.

## In Closing
Overall I really enjoyed all 5 books this week and I am really looking forward to next week. Thank you for reading, and if you have read or end up reading any of the books mentioned I’d absolutely love to hear your thoughts.
