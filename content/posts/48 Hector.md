## Emily
*by Michael Bedard, pictures by Barbara Cooney*

Published 1992. There is a sense of European flavor to the artwork in this book, I think it is the combination of color and oil paints. The story is a nice glimpse into the life of Emily Dickenson. I enjoyed my time with the book, but the text was a bit long. I felt there were many areas that could've been edited down. The artwork is great but it doesn't push the text. The text also doesn't push the artwork to create a lasting reason to keep pushing through this book, besides having an interest in its topic. A lovely book but it just feels like the puzzle pieces it is trying to put together are all from different puzzles. 
 
## Hector the Collector

Published 2017. The artwork works for the story and is well done with a nice variety of compositions and spreads. The story is almost fully there. For most of the story, I get hints of what I found in John's Turn by Mac Barnett. But, this story by Emily Beeny could use just a few more elements of the 'reality' in those moments she is speaking to. Those moments might not be completely 'nice', but they give a sense of realism to the whole story; that the story demands it. The text could use more colorful and sense-based language to further entice the imagination of this book. The book is still quite good, interesting, and worth a read. It's so close to being an absolute favorite and must-read. 
 
## The Bear Who Stared
*by Duncan Beedie*

Published 2016. I immediately loved the feel of the paper. It's smooth but has a subtle texture that perfectly complements the artwork. It's very cozy and nice. The text/story was good to a point. But by the middle, it became a bit too on the nose with its message. I'm not sure how I felt about the message of just a smile changing the outcome/bear, but then again, attitude can change a lot. 
 
## Worst in Show
*by William Bee and Kate Hindley*

Published 2015. The artwork was good, very well done, and told a bunch of funny jokes based on the text. The story was sweet in the end and it felt real which is an odd thing to say about a book on a monster competition. 
 
## Bedtime for Little Bears!
*by David Bedford and Caroline Pedler*

Published 2007. Stunning color and painterly strokes, fantastic artwork. The story is a fairly simple and straightforward tale that leads to a bedtime/go-to-sleep message. Well done and worth a read, especially around bedtime.
