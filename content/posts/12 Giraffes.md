## Pioneer Girl
*By William Anderson, Illustrated by Dan Andreasen*

Published 1998, The illustrations are gorgeous, with excellent color and texture. This is an incredibly wordy story, the story itself is very slice of life, and I found it an interesting telling of life from long ago.

## Giraffes Can't Dance 
*By Giles Andreae and Guy Parker-Rees*

Published 1999, I love the artwork's playfulness, and the colors play well to the action in the drawings. The play with typefaces is fun and fitting. The text is very thematic and has a great rhythm and flow. The story's truth is lovely and, overall, a great story from start to finish. I like what it says about self and finding that 'music' that makes you shine and gives you your best self. <h style="color:#E7A526;">★</h>


## The Kid Who Changed the World
*By Andy Andrews, Illustrated by Philip Hurst*

Published 2010, Solid watercolor illustrations and saturated colors make this book pop. On a surface level, the story is excellent and a reminder of those who tread paths for our success before us to walk and learn from and how what we do matters. The things used in the story and how it uses certain things are a bit too set in the realistic, this book could've been a lot more fun, and the truth of the story could've been better conveyed with a stronger story. Still, it is based on a true story.

## ABC Animal Jamboree
*By Giles Andreae, Illustrated by David Wojtowycz*

Published 2009, Cute illustrations also show some of the artist's mark-making. I thought at first there would be an overall story about all the animals, but there wasn't. It was an informative book about animals. I wish it would've gone beyond and had some overall message to strengthen the book. It is a great ABC book.

## The Giant of Seville
*By Dan Andreasen*

Published 2007, Another story based on a true story, but has a feel of fiction that adds to the charm of this story. At points, it is ridiculous and unbelievable and a stretch of the truth, but the mindset of it being a true story makes it a fun dynamic to read about. I didn't enjoy how the story made the main character, at times, a vehicle of amusement for the rest of the townsfolk and that it was never addressed or any growth in that aspect, even if they were trying to be kind. The message is good that we need a community, and a community with a big heart can accomplish a lot.
