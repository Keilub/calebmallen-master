I remember my family reading me Allan Ahlberg books when a child, and I can certainly say I still enjoy his writing today. While reading his 3 books from the selection this week, I went on a google journey and found this interesting read on Mr. Ahlberg.


## It was a Dark and Stormy Night
*by Janet & Allan Ahlberg*

1993, Immediately enjoy the artwork, was very nostalgic for me and I am always sucker for some nice drop caps. The story is very word heavy with lots of text on every page, but there is a charm to every word used and I found most of what was written necessary for the story, which I liked… even if a bit predictable. Had the feeling of a long form fairytale.


## The Pencil
*by Allan Ahlberg & Bruce Ingman*

2008, A bit wordy in spots but another great concept for a story. Enjoyed the conflict, but I did feel the resolution could’ve been more whimsical and the point of conflict could’ve been raised higher. Overall a good book with plenty of pages that still left me wanting more!


## The Shopping Expedition
*by Andre Amstutz & Allan Ahlberg*

2005, Fantastic art, the textures and mark making are mesmerizing and left me lingering on the pages long after I had finished the text. The text is sparse and thus this is a quick and simple read. Not much to say about the little tale, but good truth’s of ‘keeping going’ through adversity and a fun silly story of a journey to the store.


## Under the Great Plum Tree
*by Sufiya Ahmed & Reza Dalvand*

2019, Really enjoyed this, felt like a classic fairytale and had me glued to the pages, I am a sucker for the whimsical and abstractness a fairytale can have. The story has some great truths to tell on compassion, being fooled, and forgiveness. A quick read, but I did get a little confused at a certain part, but that could’ve just been my brain quacking out while reading. Lovely and vivid colors in the artwork and lots of great patterns and compositions.


## The Nature Girls
*by Aki*

Was fun to read with rhythmic text that really flowed along. A learn book on earth’s biomes but not preachy, a fantastic tidbit of learning to be gained here. No direct message but you can take a message of the joys of adventuring/journeying together. Really great lifework in the illustrations and pleasant colors.
