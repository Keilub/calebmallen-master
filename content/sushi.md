<h5 style="color: #5ABB71;">Sushi!</h5>

Sushi also loves bird watching. If not under a warm blanket, Sushi snuggles up by a window, chittering at the wildlife that flutters and pounces around our home. Sushi, a big spoiled brat is always meowing for food, and is terrified of rain storms. He is from a friends farm (one of the oldest farms in the state actually).
